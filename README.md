# Acrolinx SDK Kotlin

Unofficial, experimental and totally incomplete Kotlin client library for the Acrolinx platform API.

You can find the official Acrolinx SDKs at [https://github.com/acrolinx](https://github.com/acrolinx).

## How to start

Have a look at [AcrolinxEndpoint](./src/main/kotlin/AcrolinxEndpoint.kt) and use it.

## Integration tests

In order to run the integration tests:
* You need an Acrolinx server
* You need to create an .env file similar to the [.env.template](.env.template) file. Alternately you can set the corresponding env variables in a different way.
